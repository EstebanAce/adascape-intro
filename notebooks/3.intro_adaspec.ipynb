    "*AdaScape* is a python package with routines to predict the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of individuals as their environment changes at larger (hundreds to thousands of kilometres) and longer (thousand to millions of years) scales. The adaptive speciation model presented here build on the *adaptive dynamics* theoretical framework ([Dieckmann et al. 2007](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-34428-5_8); [Brännström et al. 2012](https://www.evolutionary-ecology.com/abstracts/v14/2747.html); [McGill & Brown 2012](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.36.091704.175517)), which focus on the evolution of a trait (or various traits) and is affected by processes of **environmental selection, mutation, dispersal, and ecological interactions**. In particular, we have modified the simple speciation model proposed by [Irwin 2012](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/666002) to consider a) more than trait, b)competion for a limiting resrouce, and c) a trait definition that allow us to reconstruct phylogenetic trees.
