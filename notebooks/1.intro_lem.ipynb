Then we can focus on the effect that surface processes such as fluvial and hillslope processes have on the topography of a mountain. Particularly we will explore the effects that fluvial processes such as river incision $I$ and hillslope processes $H$ have on the height of a given mountain area. \n",

    "River incision, also known as [stream power law](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/esp.3462), in simpler terms describes how a flow of water \"cuts\" through bedrock in a process that can be characterised by the product of **a constant of erodability** $\\mathbf{k_f}$, the drainage area $A$ (in $m^2$) and the slope of the terrain $S$ (in $m/m$), where the two latter expressions are power functions with exponents, respectively, $\\mathbf{m}$ and $\\mathbf{n}$. We know these exponents take values of $m \\in [0.3, 0.8]$ and $n \\in [1, 2]$, where their ratio $n/m$ is better constrained and can be determined by the concavity of the river profile $n/m \\in [0.4, 0.6]$.\n",
